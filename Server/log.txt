Yo, Biggie, let me break it down, listen clear,  
Electric cars rollin’ in, the future’s right here.  
No more fumes in the air, can you feel that vibe?  
Clean energy hustlin’, watch the planet thrive.  

Gasoline's a relic, a dinosaur, it’s true,  
Oil spills and pollution, man, we gotta push through.  
Silent but deadly, that torque’s insane,  
With a flick of the wrist, I’m spittin’ like a hurricane.  

Charge up my ride, plug it in, watch it glow,  
No gas station stops, just a smooth electric flow.  
Sustainability's the key, the planet’s in our hands,  
Let’s drive into the future, take a stand with the fans.  

So while you’re stuck in traffic, with that exhaust in sight,  
I’ll be cruisin’ the streets, eco-friendly,

Yeah, gas pumps stink, but they fuel the hustle,  
Give me that V8 rumble, feel the power, flex the muscle.  
Road trips with the crew, windows down, feel that breeze,  
Electric whips can’t match the vibe of gas-powered keys.

Give me that V8 rumble, feel the power, flex the muscle.  
Road trips with the crew, windows down, feel that breeze,  
Electric whips can’t match the vibe of gas-powered keys.  

So plug in if you want, but I’m still rollin'

Yo, Nas, I hear you, but let me set it straight,  
Ain't no future in the silence, gotta appreciate the fate.  
Gas cars roar like lions, they command the scene,  
Feel the power in the engine, know what I mean?  

You talkin’ ‘bout the planet, but let’s keep it real,  
Battery production’s dirty, that’s a hard deal to conceal.  
Mining lithium for batteries, toxic waste in the ground,  
While you’re livin’ in a dream, I’m just spittin’ the sound.  

Yeah, gas pumps stink, but they fuel the hustle,  
Give me that V8 rumble, feel the power, flex the muscle.  
Road trips with the crew, windows down, feel that breeze,  
Electric whips can’t match the vibe of gas-powered keys.
