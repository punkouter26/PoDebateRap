Yo, it's Three Stacks, stepping in the digital scene,  
Gonna break it down, let me paint you a dream,  
Social media's a canvas, a vast tapestry,  
Connecting souls worldwide, like a symphony.  

They said it’s a curse, but I see the blessings,  
Voices amplified, no need for second-guessing,  
From activism to art, we raising the stakes,  
A platform for the people, watch the progress it makes.  

Scroll through the timeline, see the stories unfold,  
From hashtags to movements, we’re bold and we’re gold,  
A click can ignite, inspire a fight,  
From Ferguson to marches, we shining the light.  

So Kendrick, my brother, let’s celebrate the shift,  
Social media's a tool, man, it’s more than a gift,  
It’s a voice for the voiceless, a stage for the meek

Got love for the culture, but I gotta break through,  
You talkin' 'bout blessings, but let’s flip the script,  
Social media's a virus, got society gripped.  

Yeah, it connects, but it also divides,  
Feeding the hate, where empathy subsides,  
Scrollin' through feeds, we lose sight of the real,  
Validation through likes? Man, that’s a raw deal.  

We postin' our lives like a highlight reel,  
But behind those screens, tell me, what do we feel?  
Anxiety spikes, depression on the rise,  
A world full of followers, but no one’s truly wise.  

Influencers flexin’ with their curated lives,  
While the truth's buried deep where the chaos thrives,  
Algorithms feeding us what we wanna see,

Yo, it's K. Dot, stepping back with a view,  
Got love for the culture, but I gotta break through,  
You talkin' 'bout blessings, but let’s flip the script,  
Social media's a virus, got society gripped.  

Yeah, it connects, but it also divides,  
Feeding the hate, where empathy subsides,  
Scrollin' through feeds, we lose sight of the real,  
Validation through likes? Man, that’s a raw deal.  

We postin' our lives like a highlight reel,  
But behind those screens, tell me, what do we feel?  
Anxiety spikes, depression on the rise,  
A world full of followers, but no one’s truly wise.

A platform for healing, a space to confide,  
Mental health awareness, let the truth be our guide.

Andre 3000 (Turn 1):
(Verse 1: Andre 3000)

Yo, it's Three Stacks, stepping in the digital scene,  
Gonna break it down, let me paint you a dream,  
Social media's a canvas, a vast tapestry,  
Connecting souls worldwide, like a symphony.  

They said it’s a curse, but I see the blessings,  
Voices amplified, no need for second-guessing,  
From activism to art, we raising the stakes,  
A platform for the people, watch the progress it makes.  

Scroll through the timeline, see the stories unfold,  
From hashtags to movements, we’re bold and we’re gold,  
A click can ignite, inspire a fight,  
From Ferguson to marches, we shining the light.  

So Kendrick, my brother, let’s celebrate the shift,  
Social media's a tool, man, it’s more than a gift,  
It’s a voice for the voiceless, a stage for the meek

Kendrick Lamar (Turn 2):
(Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar)

Yo, it's K. Dot, stepping back with a view,  
Got love for the culture, but I gotta break through,  
You talkin' 'bout blessings, but let’s flip the script,  
Social media's a virus, got society gripped.  

Yeah, it connects, but it also divides,  
Feeding the hate, where empathy subsides,  
Scrollin' through feeds, we lose sight of the real,  
Validation through likes? Man, that’s a raw deal.  

We postin' our lives like a highlight reel,  
But behind those screens, tell me, what do we feel?  
Anxiety spikes, depression on the rise,  
A world full of followers, but no one’s truly wise.  

Influencers flexin’ with their curated lives,  
While the truth's buried deep where the chaos thrives,  
Algorithms feeding us what we wanna see,  
But who’s controlling the narrative

Andre 3000 (Turn 3):
(Verse 3: Andre 3000)

Ayo, K. Dot, I hear you, but let’s elevate,  
Yeah, there’s dark sides, but we can’t underestimate,  
The way it mobilizes, ignites the flame,  
From protests to movements, we’re playing the game.  

You speak of anxiety, I see the struggle too,  
But let’s not forget how it brings us to you,  
A platform for healing, a space to confide,  
Mental health awareness, let the truth be our guide.  

Yeah, some chase clout, but that’s just a phase,  
In the sea of the fake, real ones still blaze,  
From artists to dreamers, sharing their plight,  
Social media’s a mirror reflecting our fight.  

We create, we innovate, ideas intertwine,  
Breaking barriers down, like a well-aged wine,  
So let’s lift each other, find strength in the stream,

Ayo, K. Dot, I hear you, but let’s elevate,  
Yeah, there’s dark sides, but we can’t underestimate,  
The way it mobilizes, ignites the flame,  
From protests to movements, we’re playing the game.  

You speak of anxiety, I see the struggle too,  
But let’s not forget how it brings us to you,  
A platform for healing, a space to confide,  
Mental health awareness, let the truth be our guide.  

Yeah, some chase clout, but that’s just a phase,  
In the sea of the fake, real ones still blaze,  
From artists to dreamers, sharing their plight,  
Social media’s a mirror reflecting our fight.  

We create, we innovate, ideas intertwine,  
Breaking barriers down, like a well-aged wine,  
So let’s lift each other, find strength in the stream,  
Together'

Ayo, Andre, I see your vision, but let’s rewind,  
You talk about healing, yet it's hard to find,

Swipe left, swipe right, it’s a digital game,  
But the players get lost, and it’s driving ‘em insane.  

We’re drowning in noise, drowning in trends,  
Fleeting moments of fame, but where does it end?  
You speak of innovation, but let’s not ignore,

Andre 3000 (Turn 1):
(Verse 1: Andre 3000)

Yo, it's Three Stacks, stepping in the digital scene,  
Gonna break it down, let me paint you a dream,  
Social media's a canvas, a vast tapestry,  
Connecting souls worldwide, like a symphony.  

They said it’s a curse, but I see the blessings,  
Voices amplified, no need for second-guessing,  
From activism to art, we raising the stakes,  
A platform for the people, watch the progress it makes.  

Scroll through the timeline, see the stories unfold,  
From hashtags to movements, we’re bold and we’re gold,  
A click can ignite, inspire a fight,  
From Ferguson to marches, we shining the light.  

So Kendrick, my brother, let’s celebrate the shift,  
Social media's a tool, man, it’s more than a gift,  
It’s a voice for the voiceless, a stage for the meek

Kendrick Lamar (Turn 2):
(Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar)

Yo, it's K. Dot, stepping back with a view,  
Got love for the culture, but I gotta break through,  
You talkin' 'bout blessings, but let’s flip the script,  
Social media's a virus, got society gripped.  

Yeah, it connects, but it also divides,  
Feeding the hate, where empathy subsides,  
Scrollin' through feeds, we lose sight of the real,  
Validation through likes? Man, that’s a raw deal.  

We postin' our lives like a highlight reel,  
But behind those screens, tell me, what do we feel?  
Anxiety spikes, depression on the rise,  
A world full of followers, but no one’s truly wise.  

Influencers flexin’ with their curated lives,  
While the truth's buried deep where the chaos thrives,  
Algorithms feeding us what we wanna see,  
But who’s controlling the narrative

Andre 3000 (Turn 3):
(Verse 3: Andre 3000)

Ayo, K. Dot, I hear you, but let’s elevate,  
Yeah, there’s dark sides, but we can’t underestimate,  
The way it mobilizes, ignites the flame,  
From protests to movements, we’re playing the game.  

You speak of anxiety, I see the struggle too,  
But let’s not forget how it brings us to you,  
A platform for healing, a space to confide,  
Mental health awareness, let the truth be our guide.  

Yeah, some chase clout, but that’s just a phase,  
In the sea of the fake, real ones still blaze,  
From artists to dreamers, sharing their plight,  
Social media’s a mirror reflecting our fight.  

We create, we innovate, ideas intertwine,  
Breaking barriers down, like a well-aged wine,  
So let’s lift each other, find strength in the stream,  
Together

Ayo, K. Dot, I feel the weight of your words,  
But let’s switch the lens, see the beauty, absurd.  
Yeah, it’s a jungle, but we’re the lions inside,  
Roaring for change, with our hearts open wide.  

You talk about trolls, yeah, they thrive in the shade,  
But we got the power, our voices won’t fade,  
From Twitter to TikTok, we’re crafting our way,  
Breaking down walls, we ain’t here to play.  

See, every like, every share, can spark a new thought,  
A movement reborn from the battles we fought,  
It’s the youth leading change, with their clicks and their taps,  
Creating a future, no time for the traps.  

So when hashtags fade, let’s not lose the fight,  
The spirit of unity ignites in the night,

Andre 3000 (Turn 1):
(Verse 1: Andre 3000)

Yo, it's Three Stacks, stepping in the digital scene,  
Gonna break it down, let me paint you a dream,  
Social media's a canvas, a vast tapestry,  
Connecting souls worldwide, like a symphony.  

They said it’s a curse, but I see the blessings,  
Voices amplified, no need for second-guessing,  
From activism to art, we raising the stakes,  
A platform for the people, watch the progress it makes.  

Scroll through the timeline, see the stories unfold,  
From hashtags to movements, we’re bold and we’re gold,  
A click can ignite, inspire a fight,  
From Ferguson to marches, we shining the light.  

So Kendrick, my brother, let’s celebrate the shift,  
Social media's a tool, man, it’s more than a gift,  
It’s a voice for the voiceless, a stage for the meek

Kendrick Lamar (Turn 2):
(Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar)

Yo, it's K. Dot, stepping back with a view,  
Got love for the culture, but I gotta break through,  
You talkin' 'bout blessings, but let’s flip the script,  
Social media's a virus, got society gripped.  

Yeah, it connects, but it also divides,  
Feeding the hate, where empathy subsides,  
Scrollin' through feeds, we lose sight of the real,  
Validation through likes? Man, that’s a raw deal.  

We postin' our lives like a highlight reel,  
But behind those screens, tell me, what do we feel?  
Anxiety spikes, depression on the rise,  
A world full of followers, but no one’s truly wise.  

Influencers flexin’ with their curated lives,  
While the truth's buried deep where the chaos thrives,  
Algorithms feeding us what we wanna see,  
But who’s controlling the narrative

Andre 3000 (Turn 3):
(Verse 3: Andre 3000)

Ayo, K. Dot, I hear you, but let’s elevate,  
Yeah, there’s dark sides, but we can’t underestimate,  
The way it mobilizes, ignites the flame,  
From protests to movements, we’re playing the game.  

You speak of anxiety, I see the struggle too,  
But let’s not forget how it brings us to you,  
A platform for healing, a space to confide,  
Mental health awareness, let the truth be our guide.  

Yeah, some chase clout, but that’s just a phase,  
In the sea of the fake, real ones still blaze,  
From artists to dreamers, sharing their plight,  
Social media’s a mirror reflecting our fight.  

We create, we innovate, ideas intertwine,  
Breaking barriers down, like a well-aged wine,  
So let’s lift each other, find strength in the stream,  
Together

Kendrick Lamar (Turn 4):
(Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar)

Ayo, Andre, I see your vision, but let’s rewind,  
You talk about healing, yet it's hard to find,  
In a world full of trolls, lurking in the dark,  
Social media's a jungle, and it's leaving a mark.  

Yeah, movements ignite, but they often fade,  
When the hashtags die out, and the truth gets portrayed,  
Swipe left, swipe right, it’s a digital game,  
But the players get lost, and it’s driving ‘em insane.  

We’re drowning in noise, drowning in trends,  
Fleeting moments of fame, but where does it end?  
You speak of innovation, but let’s not ignore,  
The echo chambers thriving, keeping us poor.  

Data harvested, privacy’s a joke,  
Algorithms deciding what we get provoked,  
You say it’s a mirror, but it’s cracked at the seams,  
Reflecting a world where

Andre 3000 (Turn 5):
(Verse 5: Andre 3000)

Ayo, K. Dot, I feel the weight of your words,  
But let’s switch the lens, see the beauty, absurd.  
Yeah, it’s a jungle, but we’re the lions inside,  
Roaring for change, with our hearts open wide.  

You talk about trolls, yeah, they thrive in the shade,  
But we got the power, our voices won’t fade,  
From Twitter to TikTok, we’re crafting our way,  
Breaking down walls, we ain’t here to play.  

See, every like, every share, can spark a new thought,  
A movement reborn from the battles we fought,  
It’s the youth leading change, with their clicks and their taps,  
Creating a future, no time for the traps.  

So when hashtags fade, let’s not lose the fight,  
The spirit of unity ignites in the night,  
From the ashes of chaos

Ayo, K. Dot, I feel the weight of your words,  
But let’s switch the lens, see the beauty, absurd.  
Yeah, it’s a jungle, but we’re the lions inside,  
Roaring for change, with our hearts open wide.  

You talk about trolls, yeah, they thrive in the shade,  
But we got the power, our voices won’t fade,  
From Twitter to TikTok, we’re crafting our way,  
Breaking down walls, we ain’t here to play.  

See, every like, every share, can spark a new thought,  
A movement reborn from the battles we fought,  
It’s the youth leading change, with their clicks and their taps,  
Creating a future, no time for the traps.  

So when hashtags fade, let’s not lose the fight,  
The spirit of unity ignites in the night,  
From the ashes of chaos'

Andre 3000 (Turn 1):
(Verse 1: Andre 3000)

Yo, it's Three Stacks, stepping in the digital scene,  
Gonna break it down, let me paint you a dream,  
Social media's a canvas, a vast tapestry,  
Connecting souls worldwide, like a symphony.  

They said it’s a curse, but I see the blessings,  
Voices amplified, no need for second-guessing,  
From activism to art, we raising the stakes,  
A platform for the people, watch the progress it makes.  

Scroll through the timeline, see the stories unfold,  
From hashtags to movements, we’re bold and we’re gold,  
A click can ignite, inspire a fight,  
From Ferguson to marches, we shining the light.  

So Kendrick, my brother, let’s celebrate the shift,  
Social media's a tool, man, it’s more than a gift,  
It’s a voice for the voiceless, a stage for the meek

Kendrick Lamar (Turn 2):
(Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar)

Yo, it's K. Dot, stepping back with a view,  
Got love for the culture, but I gotta break through,  
You talkin' 'bout blessings, but let’s flip the script,  
Social media's a virus, got society gripped.  

Yeah, it connects, but it also divides,  
Feeding the hate, where empathy subsides,  
Scrollin' through feeds, we lose sight of the real,  
Validation through likes? Man, that’s a raw deal.  

We postin' our lives like a highlight reel,  
But behind those screens, tell me, what do we feel?  
Anxiety spikes, depression on the rise,  
A world full of followers, but no one’s truly wise.  

Influencers flexin’ with their curated lives,  
While the truth's buried deep where the chaos thrives,  
Algorithms feeding us what we wanna see,  
But who’s controlling the narrative

Andre 3000 (Turn 3):
(Verse 3: Andre 3000)

Ayo, K. Dot, I hear you, but let’s elevate,  
Yeah, there’s dark sides, but we can’t underestimate,  
The way it mobilizes, ignites the flame,  
From protests to movements, we’re playing the game.  

You speak of anxiety, I see the struggle too,  
But let’s not forget how it brings us to you,  
A platform for healing, a space to confide,  
Mental health awareness, let the truth be our guide.  

Yeah, some chase clout, but that’s just a phase,  
In the sea of the fake, real ones still blaze,  
From artists to dreamers, sharing their plight,  
Social media’s a mirror reflecting our fight.  

We create, we innovate, ideas intertwine,  
Breaking barriers down, like a well-aged wine,  
So let’s lift each other, find strength in the stream,  
Together

Kendrick Lamar (Turn 4):
(Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar)

Ayo, Andre, I see your vision, but let’s rewind,  
You talk about healing, yet it's hard to find,  
In a world full of trolls, lurking in the dark,  
Social media's a jungle, and it's leaving a mark.  

Yeah, movements ignite, but they often fade,  
When the hashtags die out, and the truth gets portrayed,  
Swipe left, swipe right, it’s a digital game,  
But the players get lost, and it’s driving ‘em insane.  

We’re drowning in noise, drowning in trends,  
Fleeting moments of fame, but where does it end?  
You speak of innovation, but let’s not ignore,  
The echo chambers thriving, keeping us poor.  

Data harvested, privacy’s a joke,  
Algorithms deciding what we get provoked,  
You say it’s a mirror, but it’s cracked at the seams,  
Reflecting a world where

Andre 3000 (Turn 5):
(Verse 5: Andre 3000)

Ayo, K. Dot, I feel the weight of your words,  
But let’s switch the lens, see the beauty, absurd.  
Yeah, it’s a jungle, but we’re the lions inside,  
Roaring for change, with our hearts open wide.  

You talk about trolls, yeah, they thrive in the shade,  
But we got the power, our voices won’t fade,  
From Twitter to TikTok, we’re crafting our way,

A movement reborn from the battles we fought,  
It’s the youth leading change, with their clicks and their taps,  
Creating a future, no time for the traps.  

So when hashtags fade, let’s not lose the fight,  
The spirit of unity ignites in the night,  
From the ashes of chaos
